readgml
There are many dataset published in Graph Markup Language (not XML), which is similar to Jason in that defines objects and properties hierarchically.
To process these datasets first you need to convert the data to TSB.
I downloaded a GML parser written in C called "readgml" and added a function to output the network in TSB format.
