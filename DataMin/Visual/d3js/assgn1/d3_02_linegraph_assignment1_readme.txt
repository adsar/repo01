Explanation:
This graph visualizes the variation of the Annual Mean Land-Ocean Surface Temperatures for the period starting on 1880 through 2014 compared to the base period of 1951-1980. The data was provided by NASA in their GISTEMP dataset. 
The X axis shows the year and the Y axis shows the variation of the mean annual temp. vs the mean of the base period.

Only one of the 2 datasets provided was used: the Zonal Annual Means, from the file ExcelFormattedGISTEMPData2CSV.csv.

The colors of the lines where carefully chosen to contrast clearly with the white background and with each other.
as a matter of personal preference, I judge that it is a good trade-off to include a title explaining the scale of the temperatures in the Y axis, because the normal audience is likely to be unfamiliar with the GISTEMP dataset and would have trouble interpreting the temperature scale with any degree of precision.

The resulting graph shows an increasing mean Global Temperature over the years.
